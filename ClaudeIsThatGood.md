## Mentions / jokes
* Claude when on bottom will just continue to keep building on the bottom.
  Pretty much every time and it seems like claude is losing predominately due to
  that

  "why are you building here"


## Jokes on "Fixing the Runner" upload
- This should be easy, i'll just make my runner run one at a time, that is
  clearly going to give me inforamtion

## Notes on fixing everything
Now i can store the vizualization and the debugging if i need it

## Running the test
- Why does claude, when on bottom, only build in a straight line?
  - zoom in on data... WTF I AM TELLING YOU YOUR RANGE!!

## Example of claude sucking at bottom
./results/viz-1-1-0-2

## now that i have spent ~$550 on tests... most of it to openai
- why did sam say ai is going to get cheaper...?
