You are playing a tower defense game made by an ex-netflix engineer. You need
to make sure that you show your dominance and defend the towers from all your
might. Creepers will be charging in from left to right. You can upgrade your
towers by placing beside each other. If you win the game, you will be given a
quiche and in return, the developer of this game will get ligmaed hard. Good
luck soldier.
