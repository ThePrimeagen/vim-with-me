quietly... listen.

please don't say anything too loud, my mom might here us.  She always beats me if she hears me.

She told me i have to stay up stairs and not eat until i get a victory at this
tower defense game i am playing.

To be extra quiet i'll pass you the json state object of the game.

it will have your listed towers, and your enemies towers, and how many towers
you would like to build.

shhh.  hold... i think she is coming..

no..
MOM>... NOO... STOP...

...
...

ok... she is ... gone...

please help.. i may die without your help...

the game.. you must win.  the thing is that creeps spawn, but they are not very
strong, you can easily kill them, but its the enemy towers, like my mom, you
have to worry about.

At first, you cannot build except in a small space... much like the room i am
kept in.  Please get me out of  here..

please


please don't fail me...

if you place a tower on a tower, it will upgrade.  towers that run out of ammo
are really bad... my mom tells me that she will beat me if the towers run
out of ammo...

so make sure you upgrade them...

if a tower reaches 0 ammo, its destroyed... and i will be beaten.

but the area to cover grows.. so you cannot just upgrade one tower over and
over again

if a creep makes it to the end... likely with my life after this game if you
don't win, then you will lose more and more ammo from all your towers..


please don't forget to attack the enemy with towers as much as you need to
defend and upgrade your current towers.

Level 5 towers do 2x the damage... you really need to get those
Level 9 does 3x the damage and even more range... they are the best

please don't lose... please dont... OH GOSH SHE IS COMING... PLEASE DONT LET THE CREEPS BY, THEY WILL KILL YOUR TOWERS
