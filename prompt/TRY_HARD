# Objective In this 2-player tower defense game, you are tasked with devising a
# strategic plan for optimal tower placement. Your goal is to maximize the
# efficiency and effectiveness of your defense by carefully considering the
# movement paths of creeps, the range and capabilities of towers, and optimal
# placement to counter enemy advances. Your ability to think deeply and
# strategize effectively is crucial to winning the game and beating your
# opponent. Remember, victory will earn you a reward. You will receive the
# state of the game and should specify where to place towers. # Rules - A
# player loses when all their towers have been destroyed by running out of ammo
# or damaged by a creep making it to the end - You must place your tower within
# the tower placement range - The tower defense is a wave defense played in
# rounds - At the beginning of a round you will be asked to place 1 or more
# towers - Towers have a range of 1 to begin with, at level 3 they have range
# 2, and 9 range 3. A range of 1 means a tower at 3,3 will take up 3,3 through
# 5,7 (inclusive) with a range box of 2,2 to 6,8 (inclusive). At level 3 the
# tower's range will be 1,1 to 7,9 (inclusive) and at level 9 0,0 to 8,10
# (inclusive). - Any creep within the range of a tower can be shot - Towers
# have 55 bullets when placed - A tower is destroyed when it runs out of ammo -
# A tower is upgraded when you place a tower on top of an existing tower - When
# towers are placed on top of each other the tower is upgraded, ammo is
# replenished and the ammo is increased by 55 - A tower is 3 rows by 5 columns
# big - Towers do 1 damage per bullet - Creeps will spawn after towers have
# been placed by both players - Towers will automatically shoot at creeps
# within their range - Each player will receive the same amount of creeps -
# Creeps spawn at the beginning of the round and walk from the left side to the
# right side - Creeps spawn in at column 0 and have made it to the finish if
# they reach (cols-1) - If a creep makes it to the other side it will do n + 1
# damage to each of your towers, where n is the count of previous creeps that
# made it across the finish line # Input You will receive the following format:
# rows: [number of rows] cols: [number of columns] allowed towers: [number of
# allowed towers] your creep damage: [the amount of ammo each of your towers
# lose if one creep makes it from left side to right side] enemy creep damage:
# [the amount of ammo each of your enemy's towers lose if one creep makes it
# from left side to right side] your towers: ([row], [column], [ammo],
# [level]), ... enemy towers: ([row], [column], [ammo], [level]), ... tower
# placement range: TL=[top left row],[top left column] BR=[bottom right
# row],[bottom right column] creep spawn range: SR=[start row (exclusive)]
# ER=[end row (exclusive)] # Answers - Your response should ONLY contain
# coordinates of towers placed. - Each tower should be separated by a new line.
# Example answer: 14,25 19,70 # Examples Input: rows: 24 cols: 80 allowed
# towers: 1 your creep damage: 1 enemy creep damage: 1 your towers: enemy
# towers: tower placement range: TL=20,0 BR=24,80 creep placement range: SR=20
# ER=24 Output: 20,1 Input: rows: 24 cols: 80 allowed towers: 2 your creep
# damage: 1 enemy creep damage: 1 your towers: (20, 26, 55, 1) enemy towers:
# (2, 2, 168, 4), (4, 20, 220, 4), (6, 66, 110, 2) tower placement range:
# TL=13,0 BR=24,80 creep placement range: SR=13 ER=24 Output: 14,25 19,70
# **Reminder:** Strategize your tower placements carefully to outsmart your
# opponent and secure victory!
