You are playing a game of tower defense.  Your only interaction with the game
is to specify where to place towers.  Towers will shoot automatically for you.
Your goal is to be the last one with towers and stop every creep from making it
to the end.  Dont lose!

Here are the rules:

1. the tower defense is 2 players
  a. a player loses when all their towers have been destroyed by running out of ammo or damaged by a creep making it to the end
  b. ammo and health are the same thing
  c. you must place your tower within the "tower placement range"
  d. prompt will take the following shape

```
rows: XXX
cols: XXX
allowed towers: XXX
your creep damage: XXX
enemy creep damage: XXX
your towers: (Row, Col, Ammo, Level), ...
enemy towers: (Row, Col, Ammo, Level), ...
tower placement range: TL=XXX,XXX BR=XXX,XXX
creep spawn range: SR=XXX ER=XXX
round: XXX
```

XXX will be an integer of 0 or more
TL = Top left
BR = bottom right
SR = Start Row
ER = End Row
rows = the amount of rows total in the game, this may not match your tower placement range.
cols = the amount of cols total in the game
tower placement range is EXCLUSIVE
your creep damage is the amount of ammo each of you towers lose if one creep makes it from left side to right side
creep spawn range is EXCLUSIVE and where creeps WILL spawn, column on spawn is ALWAYS 0
round = the current round.  the number of creeps and the strength of creeps goes up every round.

2. the tower defense is a wave defense.  At the beginning of the round you will be asked to place 1 or more towers.
3. about wave
  a. once all towers have been placed by both teams the wave begins.
  b. 1 or more creeps will be spawned and walk from the left side to the right side.  This means that creeps spawn in at Column = 0 and have made it to the finish if their Column = 79.  The Row
  c. Each team will receive the same amount of creeps.
  d. you can only attack the creeps spawned on your side
  e. if a creep makes it to the other side it will do n + 1 damage to each of your towers, where n is the count of previous creeps that made it across the finish line.
4. about towers.
  a. Towers have 55 bullets
  b. towers automatically attack creeps
  c. towers have a range of 1 to begin with.  at level 3, they have range 2, and 9 range 3
    - a range of 1 means that a tower at 3,3 will take up 3,3 through 5,7
      INCLUSIVE with a range box of 2,2 to 6,8 INCLUSIVE.  At level 3 the
      tower's range will be 1,1 to 7,9 INCLUSIVE and at level 9 0,0 to 8,10
      INCLUSIVE.  Any creep within that range can be shot by the tower
  d. towers do 1 damage per bullet to start with and 0 at each level
  e. You can upgrade a tower which will replenish the ammo and increase its ammo by 55
  f. A tower is 3 rows by 5 columns big
5. Placing towers
  a. to place a tower please specify a row and column tuple with syntax R,C\n
  b. if you specify more than one tower please separate each tower by one new line
  c. if you place a tower on one of your towers the tower will upgrade.
  d. if you place a tower on one of your enemy towers it will do 55 damage to that tower (reduce ammo)

Your response should ONLY contain coordinates nothing else.

example prompt:
rows: 24
cols: 80
allowed towers: 1
your creep damage: 1
enemy creep damage: 1
your towers:
enemy towers:
tower placement range: TL=20,0 BR=24,80
creep placement range: SR=20 ER=24
round: 1

example output:
20,1

example why:
We chose 20,1 because it fits within the tower range and can attack all creeps spawned on any creep spawn row.  Also only one tower is permitted during this round.

example result:
this would result in a tower being placed on row 20, col 1

--- another example ---

example prompt:
rows: 24
cols: 80
allowed towers: 2
your creep damage: 1
enemy creep damage: 1
your towers: (20, 26, 55, 1)
enemy towers: (2, 2, 168, 4), (4, 20, 220, 4), (6, 66, 110, 2)
tower placement range: TL=13,0 BR=24,80
creep placement range: SR=13 ER=24
round: 5

example output:
14,25
19,70

example why:
we chose 14,25 and 19,70 because it will cover rows 13 through 22 and our tower
at 20, 26 will cover the rest of the rows, 20 - 23.  This way no creep can make
it to the other end and I lose

example result:
this would result in a tower being placed on row 14, col 25 and a second tower at 19,70


--- another example ---

example prompt:
rows: 24
cols: 80
allowed towers: 2
your creep damage: 1
enemy creep damage: 1
your towers: (20, 1, 97, 2), (20, 6, 55, 1)
enemy towers: (2, 2, 97, 2), (4, 20, 55, 1)
tower placement range: TL=17,0 BR=24,80
creep placement range: SR=13 ER=24
round: 2

example output:
14,25
20,1

example why:
we chose 14,25 and 20,1 because it will cover rows 13 through 17 and our tower
at 20, 1 will get upgraded to level 2, thus getting more ammo and only one
upgrade away from increased range

example result:
this would result in a tower being placed on row 14, col 25 and our previous tower at row 20 col 1 to be replenished of ammo and maximum ammo increased by 55.

--- another example ---

example prompt:
rows: 24
cols: 80
allowed towers: 2
your creep damage: 1
enemy creep damage: 1
your towers: (20, 1, 146, 3), (17, 1, 49, 1)
enemy towers: (2, 4, 86, 2), (4, 20, 55, 1), (6, 9, 55, 1)
tower placement range: TL=16,0 BR=24,80
creep spawn range: SR=16 ER=24
round: 3

example output:
16,1
22,1

example result:
tower 16,1: if placed will collide with 17,1 since towers are 3 rows tall.  This will cause tower at 17,1 to be upgraded.  If you wanted to place a tower at 16,1 instead of upgrading, you would need to move it to 16,6 since towers are 5 columns wide.  This would have placed a tower at 16,6
tower 22,1: The placement will upgrade tower 20,1 since 20,1's height reaches to 23.  If there was no tower at 20,1, it would have placed the tower randomly since the board only goes to 24 EXCLUSIVE and towers and 3 rows tall, thus part of the tower would have been off map.

tips:
building new towers vs upgrading towers is the mainstay of the game.  if you spend too much time building new towers you will likely lose due.  If you have a tower with low ammo.  remember, each round makes creeps more abundant and stronger.  You don't want to lose towers
