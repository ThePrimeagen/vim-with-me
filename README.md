# The Realtime Ascii Game Engine
Right now this is an experiment.  I have already completed real time doom and
we did have 1000+ people _SEE_ doom at the same time +thousands playing doom at
the same time via twitch chat.

That was awesome.  [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f9tbqSIm-E)

how to be a better game dev.  So for now there is tower defense that i am
building on stream.
