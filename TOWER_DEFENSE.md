# Intro
Ok, I want to make an AI play a tower defense

Why an AI?

To test who is smarter,

** **math symbols** **
** **gpt symbol** **
ChatGPT 4 whos training data is sized at 570 gb and the number of parameters is
1.7 trillion

or TwitchChat:  Home to goonmaxxers, quiche eaters, and arch users
   taht full body pokimane pillow is looking quite good right now

----------------------------------

And the game will be made with **ascii art**
(show acerola ascii art) https://youtu.be/gg40RWiaHRY?si=harh416QlKMaQWLM&t=797

> No ... that is acerola...

ASCII because i am untalented graphic designer:

    "big booty girl...oh thats just a dick"

----------------------------------

But how should the tower defense work?  Especially if we are using ChatGPT?
Real time responses isn't really GPTs strong suit

**explain the game**
1. Tower defense will have two sides
1. The middle section will slowly disappear
1. Creeps will be wave style where between each wave you can build 1 or more
   towers
1. Both players get to build the same amount of towers
1. Towers have limited amount of shots before they are destroyed.
1. If you place a tower on a tower that is yours, you upgrade the tower which replenishes and increases the ammo, increases damage and range.
1. If a creep makes it to the other side, whatever team had the creep will have
   all their towers receive a small amount of damage and increases every creep
   that gets by

---------------------------

So this should be easy,

**37 Files and 4,025 Lines of code later**

Nope... that wasn't easy

1. UI/UX suck

If you don't know this i am somewhat of a UI engineer myself

---------------------------

**Montage the UI up to where the creep doesn't get shot**

"Now this is looking better"

**draw a bunch of arrows and play it over and over**
"oh... what is wrong with you tower, what is wrong with you... just shoot them.... just shoot them"

---------------------------

**Montage up to the enemies going backwards**

**I need 50ccs of A\* **

**Montage A* **
**Should co montage a* ackshually running to show people what is going on**

---------------------------

The game is ready, just no ChatGPT yet...
