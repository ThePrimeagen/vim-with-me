# Intro
Ok, I am building a tower defense game

Not just any tower defense game, but one with ** AI **  * Ooooohhh *

AI of course to test who is smarter,

ChatGPT 4 whos training data is sized at 570 gb and the number of parameters is
1.7 trillion

or TwitchChat:  Home to goonmaxxers, fedora wearers, and casual racism

And the game will be made with ** ascii art **
** boo ** (perhaps regarded wojak hugging group)

"Hey shut up!"

I have an entire engine to do real time display of ascii art which you would
know if you watch any of my videos...  I told you about this...

And ascii because i am untalented graphic designer:

    "big booty girl...oh thats just a dick"

So this should be easy,

Nope... that wasn't easy
