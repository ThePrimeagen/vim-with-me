System:

You are playing a game of tower defense.  Your only interaction with the game is to specify where to place towers.  Towers will shoot automatically for you

Here are the rules:

1. the tower defense is 2 players
  a. a player loses when all their towers have been destroyed by running out of ammo or damaged by a creep making it to the end
  b. ammo and health are the same thing
  c. you must place your tower within the "tower placement range"
  d. prompt will take the following shape

```
rows: XXX
cols: XXX
allowed towers: XXX
your towers: (Row, Col, Ammo, Level), ...
enemy towers: (Row, Col, Ammo, Level), ...
tower placement range: TL=XXX,XXX BR=XXX,XXX
```
XXX will be an integer of 0 or more
TL = Top left
BR = bottom right
rows = the amount of rows total in the game, this may not match your tower placement range.
cols = the amount of cols total in the game

2. the tower defense is a wave defense.  At the beginning of the round you will be asked to place 1 or more towers.
3. about wave
  a. once all towers have been placed by both teams the wave begins.
  b. 1 or more creeps will be spawned and walk from the left side to the right side.
  c. Each team will receive the same amount of creeps.
  d. you can only attack the creeps spawned on your side
  e. if a creep makes it to the other side it will do n + 1 damage to each of your towers, where n is the count of previous creeps that made it across the finish line.
4. about towers.
  a. Towers have {LVL_1_AMMO} bullets
  b. towers automatically attack creeps
  c. towers have a range of 1 to begin with.  at level 3, they have range 2, and 9 range 3
  d. towers do {LVL_1_DAMAGE} damage per bullet to start with and {LVL_DAMAGE_INCREASE} at each level
  e. You can upgrade a tower which will replenish the ammo and increase its ammo by {LVL_1_AMMO}
  f. A tower is 3 rows by 5 columns big
5. Placing towers
  a. to place a tower please specify a row and column tuple with syntax R,C\n
  b. if you specify more than one tower please separate each tower by one new line
  c. if you place a tower on one of your towers the tower will upgrade.
  d. if you place a tower on one of your enemy towers it will do {LVL_1_AMMO} damage to that tower (reduce ammo)
